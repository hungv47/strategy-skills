# Experiment Design — Orchestrator

*Strategy — Step 4 of 4. Designs minimum viable tests with clear success/iterate/kill rules.*

**Core Question:** "What's the cheapest way to learn if this works?"

---

## Critical Gates — Read First

1. **Executable in ≤2 weeks.** If the experiment takes longer than 2 weeks, it's not a minimum viable test. Simplify the design or switch test type.
2. **Success threshold MUST be a specific number.** "Significant improvement" or "we'll know it when we see it" are not thresholds. "≥2.5% signup rate" is a threshold. Define before launching.
3. **Sample size MUST be checked.** If insufficient for A/B, adjust: bigger swing, lower confidence, Before-After, or Pilot. Never rationalize "let's just go with what feels right."
4. **Guardrail metrics are mandatory.** A test can "succeed" on the primary metric while degrading support tickets, error rates, or refund rates. Define at least 2 guardrail metrics with specific thresholds.

---

## Philosophy

Experimental rigor matters — but the level should match the stakes. Sample size tables assume 95% confidence / 80% power, appropriate for high-stakes decisions. For lower-stakes tests (social creative, email subjects), 90% confidence may suffice. Define acceptable risk upfront.

## Inputs Required
- An initiative with hypothesis and target metric (from `.agents/solution-design.md` + `.agents/targets.md`)
- Baselines from `.agents/targets.md` (required for sample size calculation and lift targets)
- OR: User describes what they want to test

## Output
- `.agents/experiment-[name].md`

## Chain Position
Previous: `funnel-planner` | Next: implement winning variant, or re-diagnose with `problem-analysis` if inconclusive

**Re-run triggers:** When prior experiment results become stale (>60 days), when testing a new initiative from solution-design, or when baselines in targets.md are updated.

## Agent Manifest

| # | Agent | Layer | Focus | Input | Output |
|---|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | [test-design-agent](agents/test-design-agent.md) | L1 (parallel) | Test type selection, experiment structure | Initiative + baselines | Test design with hypothesis and variants |
| 2 | [metrics-agent](agents/metrics-agent.md) | L1 (parallel) | Decision rules, success/iterate/kill thresholds | Initiative + baselines + targets | Decision thresholds + guardrail definitions |
| 3 | [sample-size-agent](agents/sample-size-agent.md) | L2 (sequential) | Sample size calculation, sufficiency check | Merged L1 output | Sample calculation + adjustments |
| 4 | [guardrail-agent](agents/guardrail-agent.md) | L2 (sequential) | Breach protocols, rollback plan | Sample-size output + metrics | Breach scenario matrix + monitoring plan |
| 5 | [critic-agent](agents/critic-agent.md) | L2 (sequential) | 5-point quality gate | Complete analysis | PASS or FAIL with fix routing |

---

## Routing Logic

### Route A: Full Experiment Design (Default)

For any initiative that needs a properly designed test.

```
Layer 1 (parallel):  test-design-agent + metrics-agent
         ↓ merge
Layer 2 (sequential): sample-size-agent → guardrail-agent → critic-agent
```

### Route B: Quick Experiment

When the test type is obvious and the user just needs decision rules and sample validation.

```
test-design-agent → sample-size-agent → critic-agent
```

Skip metrics-agent (user provides thresholds) and guardrail-agent (low-stakes test). Use when:
- Test type is already decided (e.g., "run an A/B test on this headline")
- User provides their own success/kill thresholds
- Low-stakes test where guardrail complexity isn't warranted (e.g., email subject line test)

---

## Dispatch Protocol

### Pre-Dispatch: Context Gathering

#### Step 0: Product Context

Check for `.agents/product-context.md`. If missing: **Strongly recommended:** run `icp-research` (from `hungv47/marketing-skills`) first to create `.agents/product-context.md` — this skill works without it but produces significantly better analysis with it. If the user prefers not to, ask the user 8 product questions (what, who, problem, differentiator, proof points, pricing, objections, voice) and save to `.agents/product-context.md`.

If upstream artifacts' `date` fields are older than 30 days, recommend re-running upstream skills before proceeding — stale baselines invalidate sample size calculations.

#### Required Artifacts
| Artifact | Source | If Missing |
|----------|--------|------------|
| `solution-design.md` | solution-design | **INTERVIEW.** Ask what to test. |
| `targets.md` | funnel-planner | **INTERVIEW.** Ask for baseline metrics. Baselines are required — without them, sample size and lift calculations are meaningless. |

#### Optional Artifacts
| Artifact | Source | Benefit |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `product-context.md` | icp-research (from hungv47/marketing-skills) | Test design context |

#### Initiative & Target Review
Read `.agents/solution-design.md` and `.agents/targets.md` if they exist. If not, interview for:
1. "What are you trying to test? What's your hypothesis?"
2. "What metric are you measuring? What's the current baseline?"
3. "What would success look like? What would make you stop?"

A hypothesis, a target metric, and a baseline number are the minimum required inputs — without them, success criteria become subjective.

#### Route Selection
- Default → Route A (Full Experiment Design)
- If user provides thresholds + test type AND it's low-stakes → Route B

### Single-Agent Fallback

If the full orchestration is unnecessary (simple test, user has design and thresholds already), you may run the experiment design inline without dispatching agents. Apply the same quality gate (5-point checklist) before delivering.

---

## Layer 1 — Parallel: Test Design + Metrics

Dispatch **test-design-agent** and **metrics-agent** simultaneously.

### test-design-agent
- **Input:** Initiative details, baselines from targets.md, traffic data
- **References:** `references/experiment-templates.md`
- **Expected output:** Test type selection (with reasoning against all 4 types), hypothesis, variant definition, duration, budget

### metrics-agent
- **Input:** Initiative details, baselines, target values from targets.md
- **References:** `references/common-mistakes.md`
- **Expected output:** Decision rules (success/iterate/kill with specific numbers), guardrail metrics with thresholds

### Layer 1 Merge

After both agents return:
1. Combine test design (type, variants, duration) with metrics (thresholds, guardrails)
2. Verify hypothesis in test design matches the metrics baseline and target
3. If misalignment, reconcile before passing downstream
4. Pass merged output to sample-size-agent

---

## Layer 2 — Sequential: Sample Size → Guardrails → Critic

### Step 1: sample-size-agent
- **Input:** Merged L1 output (test design + metrics)
- **References:** `references/sample-size-guide.md`
- **Expected output:** Sample size calculation, sufficiency verdict, adjustments if insufficient

**If INSUFFICIENT:**
- sample-size-agent recommends adjustments (bigger swing, lower confidence, different test type)
- If test type change is recommended, re-dispatch test-design-agent with the new type
- Re-merge before proceeding

### Step 2: guardrail-agent
- **Input:** Sample-size-agent output + merged L1 (metrics with guardrail definitions)
- **References:** `references/common-mistakes.md`
- **Expected output:** Breach scenario matrix, guardrail-specific protocols, monitoring schedule, rollback plan

### Step 3: critic-agent
- **Input:** Complete merged analysis
- **Expected output:** PASS or FAIL against 5-point quality gate

---

## Critic Gate

**Maximum 2 rewrite cycles.** If the critic returns FAIL:

1. Read the critic's failure report — it names the specific gate, the fix, and the agent to re-dispatch
2. Re-dispatch ONLY the named agent(s) with the critic's feedback
3. Re-merge and send back to critic-agent
4. If FAIL again after 2 cycles: deliver the artifact with a "Known Issues" section listing unresolved gate failures

---

## Loop-Back Protocol

When an experiment concludes, follow the appropriate path:

### Kill Decision
1. Append learnings to the experiment file under `## Post-Mortem`
2. Check: Is the root cause (`.agents/problem-analysis.md`) still valid?
   - **Yes → Route to solution design:** Run `solution-design` with constraint: "[Failed approach] did not work because [reason]. Generate alternatives that avoid this failure mode."
   - **No → Route to problem analysis:** Problem may have shifted. Re-diagnose using `problem-analysis`.
3. Update `.agents/solution-design.md` — move killed initiative to "Kill" status with reason.

### Iterate Decision
1. Change exactly ONE variable from the original test
2. Maximum 2 iterations allowed before triggering Kill protocol
3. Document iteration rationale in experiment file under `## Iterations`

### Scale Decision
1. Document final results in experiment file under `## Results`
2. Move to full execution — no further testing needed for this initiative
3. Map the scaled initiative to KPIs and track attribution

## Worked Example 1: A/B Test

**Initiative:** Restore + Refine Paid Targeting. Baseline: 1.2% paid signup rate. Target: 3.0%.

### Layer 1: Parallel Dispatch

**test-design-agent:** Selects A/B test (can split paid budget 50/50, enough volume). Hypothesis: "If we use a 1% converters lookalike audience, then paid signup rate increases from 1.2% to ≥3%, because the lookalike matches our ICP better than current broad targeting." Duration: 10 days. Budget: $500 (redirected existing spend).

**metrics-agent:** Success ≥2.5%, Iterate 1.5-2.5%, Kill <1.5% after 10 days. Guardrails: CPA (must not exceed $80), landing page error rate (must stay <1%).

### Layer 2: Sequential

**sample-size-agent:** Daily paid traffic ~300. 10 days = 3,000 total → 1,500 per variant. Need ~1,300 for 50% lift at 1.2% baseline. SUFFICIENT.

**guardrail-agent:** Breach matrix defined. CPA slight breach = ≤$95, severe = >$95. Early termination if CPA >$120 for 3 consecutive days. Rollback: revert to original targeting in Meta.

**critic-agent:** PASS — all 5 gates satisfied.

## Worked Example 2: Before-After

**Initiative:** Restore Homepage Social Proof. Baseline: 52% bounce. Target: ≤42%.

### Layer 1: Parallel

**test-design-agent:** Before-After (change affects all visitors, can't split). Duration: 7 days. Budget: $0.

**metrics-agent:** Success ≤42%, Iterate 42-48%, Kill >48% after 7 days. Guardrails: signup rate (must not drop >5%), page load time (must stay <3s).

### Layer 2: Sequential

**sample-size-agent:** 800 daily visitors x 7 = 5,600. Ample for 10-point bounce rate change. SUFFICIENT.

**guardrail-agent:** Breach protocols. Signup drop >5% = pause and investigate. Load time >3s = optimize assets before continuing.

**critic-agent:** PASS.

## Anti-Patterns

**Testing the wrong level** — Most teams test CTA button colors when they should test entirely different angles. INSTEAD: Start at the top of the creative testing hierarchy: Concept/angle → Hook/headline → Visual style → Body copy → CTA.

**Testing multiple variables** — Changing the hook, CTA, and format simultaneously makes results uninterpretable. INSTEAD: Change exactly ONE element per variant. The learning is more valuable than the lift.

**Insufficient sample rationalization** — "We don't have enough traffic for statistical significance, so let's just go with what feels right." INSTEAD: Adjust the test — aim for bigger change (50%+ lift), use Before-After, or run a Pilot. Don't abandon rigor.

**Novelty effect as success** — New things get clicks initially. A variant that "wins" in 3 days may lose after 2 weeks. INSTEAD: Run tests long enough for novelty to normalize (minimum 7 days).

**Metrics without baselines** — "Let's test if this improves conversions" without knowing the current rate. INSTEAD: Every experiment requires a numeric baseline. Without one, you can't calculate lift, sample size, or significance.

**Testing without guardrails** — A test can "succeed" on the primary metric while degrading other metrics. INSTEAD: Define at least 2 guardrail metrics with specific thresholds before launching.

**Survivorship bias in iteration** — Iterating only on winners while ignoring what failures teach. INSTEAD: Kill decisions feed learnings back to solution-design. The failure mechanism often reveals a better approach.
