## AARRR (Pirate Metrics)

Developed by Dave McClure for startups and growth-focused businesses.

### Stages

| Stage | Definition | Key Question | Typical Metrics |
|-------|------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Acquisition** | How do users find you? | Where do they come from? | Visitors, signups, traffic sources |
| **Activation** | Do users have a great first experience? | Did they reach the "aha moment"? | Activation rate, time to value, onboarding completion |
| **Retention** | Do users come back? | Are they forming habits? | D1/D7/D30 retention, churn rate, session frequency |
| **Revenue** | Do users pay? | Are they valuable? | Conversion rate, ARPU, LTV |
| **Referral** | Do users tell others? | Are they advocates? | Referral rate, NPS, viral coefficient |

### Best For

- SaaS products
- Mobile apps
- Subscription businesses
- Products with free-to-paid conversion
- Growth-stage companies

### Stage Details

#### Acquisition
Users discover your product through various channels.

**Metrics to track:**
- Unique visitors
- Signup rate (visitors → signups)
- Cost per acquisition by channel
- Channel mix and attribution

**Common channels:**
- Paid (Search, Social, Display)

#### Activation
Users experience core value for the first time.

**What counts as "activated":**

- Used key feature
- Achieved first success/outcome
- Reached predefined milestone

**Metrics to track:**
- Activation rate (signups → activated)
- Time to activate
- Onboarding completion steps
- Feature adoption in first session

**Warning signs:**
- High signup, low activation = onboarding problem

#### Retention
Users return and form habits.

**Cohort timeframes:**
| Period | What it measures |
|--------|------------------|
| D1 | Immediate value |
| D7 | Early habit formation |
| D30 | Medium-term retention |
| D90+ | True stickiness |

**Metrics to track:**
- Retention curves by cohort
- Churn rate
- Session frequency
- Feature stickiness

**Retention segments:**
- Power users (daily)
- Regular users (weekly)
- Casual users (monthly)
- Churned (no activity)

#### Revenue
Users convert to paying customers.

**Conversion paths:**
- Freemium → Paid
- Trial → Paid
- Subscription tiers
- Usage-based pricing

**Metrics to track:**
- Free-to-paid conversion rate
- Trial conversion rate
- ARPU / ARPPU
- Revenue per cohort
- Expansion revenue

#### Referral
Users become advocates and bring others.

**Referral mechanics:**
- Direct invites
- Social sharing
- Affiliate programs
- User-generated content

**Metrics to track:**
- Referral rate (users who refer / total users)
- Viral coefficient (invites sent × conversion rate)
- NPS (Net Promoter Score)
- Referral conversion rate

**Viral loop:**
```
Users → Invites → New Signups → Activations → More Users → More Invites
```

### AARRR Drop-off Diagnostics

| Drop-off Point | Diagnostic Question | Typical Interventions |
|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Visit → Signup abandoned** | Targeting/messaging problem? Trust gap? | Social proof, clearer value prop, simpler signup |
| **Signup → Activation stalled** | Onboarding friction? Time-to-value too long? | Streamline onboarding, guided tour, quick wins |
| **Activation → Not returning** | First value unclear? No habit trigger? | Value reinforcement, notification timing, use case education |
| **Active → Declining** | Feature fatigue? Competition? Life change? | Feature education, check-in, competitive differentiation |
| **Active → Dormant** | Value not sustained? Need evolved? | Re-engagement content, new feature highlight |
| **Dormant → Churned** | Prevention failed? | Reactivation campaign (see churn cohorts) |
| **Revenue → Downgrade** | ROI not realized? Budget constraint? | ROI review, right-size offer, payment flexibility |
| **Active → No referral** | Not delighted? No mechanism? | NPS follow-up, simplify referral, incentivize |

**Diagnostic Tree: Signup → Activation Stall**

```
User signed up but not activated
         │
         ├─► Never returned after signup?
         │        │
         │        ├─► Email delivered? → Check deliverability
         │        │
         │        └─► Email opened? → Improve subject/timing
         │
         ├─► Returned but didn't complete onboarding?
         │        │
         │        ├─► Where did they drop? → Simplify that step
         │        │
         │        └─► How long was session? → Too complex, simplify
         │
         └─► Completed onboarding but no first action?
                  │
                  ├─► Did they find the core feature? → Better guidance
                  │
                  └─► Did they understand the value? → Clearer messaging
```

| **Free User** | Signs up for free tier/trial | Did they sign up? | Signup rate, cost per signup, channel attribution |
| **Activated** | Reaches the "aha moment" | Did they experience core value? | Activation rate, time to activate, feature adoption |
| **Converted** | Becomes paying customer | Did they hit the paywall and convert? | Free-to-paid %, trial conversion rate, time to convert |
| **Expanded** | Upgrades or increases usage | Are they getting more value? | Expansion revenue %, seat growth, tier upgrades |
| **Advocate** | Refers others, creates content | Are they bringing new users? | Referral rate, NPS, viral coefficient, UGC volume |

### Best For

- SaaS with self-serve signup
- Freemium products
- Developer tools
- Collaboration tools (network effects)
- Products where value is obvious in first session

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Healthy Range |
|--------|---------|---------------|

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| **Vanity free users** | High signups, <10% activation | Fix onboarding, reduce time to value |
| **Premature paywall** | Low signup → high churn after trial | Move paywall later, expand free tier |
| **No expansion motion** | Flat ARPU over time | Add usage-based pricing, team tiers |
| **Viral loop missing** | Zero organic growth from existing users | Add sharing mechanics, referral incentives |
| **PLG without product readiness** | Product can't sell itself | Fix UX first; PLG requires excellent self-serve experience |

### PLG Drop-off Diagnostics

| Drop-off Point | Diagnostic Question | Typical Interventions |
|----------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Visitor → No signup** | Value prop unclear? Too much friction? | Simplify signup, show product in action, reduce form fields |
| **Signup → No activation** | Onboarding too complex? Aha moment unclear? | Guided tour, progressive onboarding, quick wins |
| **Activated → No conversion** | Free tier too generous? Paywall unclear? | Value gating, usage limits, upgrade prompts |
| **Converted → No expansion** | No additional value tiers? No team features? | Usage-based pricing, team plans, premium features |
| **Active → No referral** | No sharing mechanism? Not delightful enough? | Invite flows, referral rewards, collaboration features |

### Channel Alignment for PLG

PLG motions favor channels that drive product discovery and self-serve adoption:

## Custom Funnels

When standard models don't fit.

### When to Customize

- Multiple products/lines
- Complex user journeys
- Marketplace dynamics (two-sided)
- Hybrid business models
- Industry-specific stages

### Building a Custom Funnel

1. **Map the actual user journey**
   - Interview customers
   - Analyze behavior data
   - Identify key decision points

2. **Define stage entry criteria**
   - What action moves someone to this stage?
   - What data captures this?

3. **Choose stage metrics**
   - What indicates success at this stage?
   - What indicates failure/drop-off?

4. **Validate with data**
   - Do users actually follow this path?
   - Are stages distinct and meaningful?

### Example: Marketplace Funnel

For a two-sided marketplace:

**Supply side (Sellers):**
```
Discover → Apply → Onboard → First Sale → Active → Power Seller
```

**Demand side (Buyers):**
```
Visit → Browse → First Purchase → Repeat Purchase → Loyal
```

**Platform metrics:**
- Liquidity (supply meeting demand)
- Match rate
- Time to first transaction

## Funnel Model Comparison

| Aspect | PLG | SLG | AARRR | AIDA | TOFU-MOFU-BOFU |
|--------|-----|-----|-------|------|----------------|
| Focus | Product as growth engine | Outbound + paid performance | Product + Growth | Marketing + Sales | Content + Leads |
| Stages | 6 | 7 | 5 | 4 | 3 |
| Primary motion | Self-serve adoption | Outreach + conversion | Product lifecycle | Campaign | Buyer journey |
| Best metric | Activation rate | Win rate / CAC | Retention | Conversion | Lead quality |
| Optimization | Product UX, onboarding | Targeting, sales process | Product changes | Messaging | Content strategy |
| Team ownership | Product/Growth | Sales/Performance Marketing | Growth/Product | Marketing | Marketing/Content |
| Channel emphasis | SEO, community, forums, referral | Paid ads, email, IRL, SMS, PR | All channels | Campaign-specific | Content-driven |

---

## Choosing the Right Model

Ask these questions:

| Question | If Yes → Model |
|----------|----------------|
| Does the product sell itself with minimal human touch? | **PLG** |
| Is there a free tier or freemium model? | **PLG** or AARRR |
| Is the ACV >$10K and requires demos/sales? | **SLG** |
| Does the business rely on outbound and paid channels? | **SLG** |
| Is retention critical to unit economics? | AARRR |
| Is the purchase decision quick (<1 week)? | AIDA |
| Is the sales cycle long (>30 days)? | TOFU-MOFU-BOFU or **SLG** |
| Is content the main acquisition channel? | TOFU-MOFU-BOFU |
| Is it a one-time purchase? | AIDA |
| Is there a human sales team closing deals? | **SLG** or TOFU-MOFU-BOFU |

### Hybrid Models

Many businesses combine models:
- **PLG + SLG:** Self-serve for SMB + sales-assisted for enterprise (common in SaaS). Track both funnels independently with shared revenue targets.
- **PLG + AARRR:** PLG funnel stages map closely to AARRR. Use PLG when the motion is explicitly product-led; use AARRR for general product analytics.
- **SLG + TOFU-MOFU-BOFU:** SLG for outbound, TOFU-MOFU-BOFU for inbound content. Common in B2B with both marketing and sales motions.

When choosing a hybrid, designate one model as primary (for target-setting) and the other as supplementary (for diagnostics).
