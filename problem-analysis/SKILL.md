# Problem Analysis — Orchestrator

*Strategy — Step 1 of 4. Defines the problem, forms testable hypotheses, and identifies root causes.*

**Core Question:** "What's actually causing this, and what does the evidence prove?"

---

## Critical Gates — Read First

1. **Problem statement MUST be: "[Metric] is [current] instead of [target]."** No vague problems. If the user says "things aren't going well," interview for the specific metric, current value, and target value before dispatching any agent.
2. **Do NOT skip external factors — 30%+ of problems have external causes.** The external-check-agent runs in Layer 1 alongside the tree builder. Skipping it leads to treating a symptom when the cause is environmental.
3. **If/Then/Because format required — hypotheses without "because" are unfalsifiable.** The "because" clause explains the mechanism. Without it, a rejected hypothesis teaches nothing.
4. **Do NOT confirm hypotheses without evidence — "seems likely" is not Confirmed.** Every verdict must cite a specific data point that matches or contradicts the "then" clause. Inconclusive is a valid verdict.

---

## Inputs Required
- A problem (metric decline, performance gap, strategic question)

## Output
- `.agents/problem-analysis.md`

## Chain Position
Previous: none | Next: `solution-design`

### Skill Deference
- **Have a METRIC that's underperforming** (X is at Y, should be Z)? Use this skill.
- **Have a FEATURE IDEA to spec out?** Use `discover` (from product-skills) instead.

**Re-run triggers:** When the metric shifts significantly, when new data surfaces that could change verdicts, or when a solution-design initiative is killed.

## Agent Manifest

| # | Agent | Layer | Focus | Input | Output |
|---|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | [tree-builder-agent](agents/tree-builder-agent.md) | L1 (parallel) | MECE logic tree construction | Problem statement | Tree + MECE check |
| 2 | [external-check-agent](agents/external-check-agent.md) | L1 (parallel) | External cause scanning via WebSearch | Problem statement + context | External factor assessment |
| 3 | [hypothesis-agent](agents/hypothesis-agent.md) | L2 (sequential) | If/Then/Because hypothesis formation | Merged L1 output (tree + external factors) | Ranked hypotheses |
| 4 | [data-mapper-agent](agents/data-mapper-agent.md) | L2 (sequential) | Data requirement mapping | Ranked hypotheses | Data map with sources + owners |
| 5 | [verdict-agent](agents/verdict-agent.md) | L2 (sequential) | Evidence evaluation + root cause statement | Data map + gathered evidence | Verdicts + root cause statement |
| 6 | [critic-agent](agents/critic-agent.md) | L2 (sequential) | 10-point quality gate | Complete analysis | PASS or FAIL with fix routing |

---

## Routing Logic

### Route A: Quick Diagnosis
When the problem is straightforward, data is readily available, and external factors are unlikely.

```
tree-builder-agent → hypothesis-agent → verdict-agent → critic-agent
```

Skip external-check-agent and data-mapper-agent. Use when:
- The user already provides data alongside the problem
- The problem is clearly internal (e.g., "we broke the deploy")
- Time is critical and the user confirms skipping external scan

### Route B: Full Analysis (Default)
For any non-trivial diagnosis. This is the default route.

```
Layer 1 (parallel):  tree-builder-agent + external-check-agent
         ↓ merge
Layer 2 (sequential): hypothesis-agent → data-mapper-agent → [DATA PAUSE] → verdict-agent → critic-agent
```

---

## Dispatch Protocol

### Pre-Dispatch: Context Gathering

#### Step 0: Product Context
Check for `.agents/product-context.md`. If missing: **Strongly recommended:** run `icp-research` (from `hungv47/marketing-skills`) first to create `.agents/product-context.md` — this skill works without it but produces significantly better analysis with it. If the user prefers not to, interview for 8 product dimensions (what, who, problem, differentiator, proof points, pricing, objections, voice) and save to `.agents/product-context.md`.

#### Step 1: Problem Interview
If the user describes a vague problem ("things aren't going well", "growth is slow"):
1. Ask for the specific metric and its current value
2. Ask for the target value and who set it
3. If user doesn't know the baseline, use WebSearch: `"[industry] [metric] benchmark [year]"` or `"[business type] average [metric]"`
4. Ask when it changed and whether there was an inflection point
5. Ask how big the gap is in absolute and relative terms

**Metric name + current number + target number are necessary before dispatching any agent.** Without all three, the logic tree has no anchor and branches become speculation.

Construct the problem statement:
> **[Metric] is [current number] instead of [target number]**

#### Route Selection
- If user provides data inline AND problem is clearly internal → Route A
- Otherwise → Route B (default)

### Single-Agent Fallback
If the full orchestration is unnecessary (trivial problem, user already has the tree and hypotheses), you may run the analysis inline without dispatching agents. Apply the same quality gate (10-point checklist) before delivering.

---

## Layer 1 — Parallel: Tree Building + External Scan

Dispatch **tree-builder-agent** and **external-check-agent** simultaneously.

### tree-builder-agent
- **Input:** Problem statement, gap size, timeline, inflection point
- **References:** `references/watanabe-framework.md`, `references/logic-tree-examples.md`
- **Expected output:** Logic tree (Math/Issue/Yes-No), MECE check, branch summary

### external-check-agent
- **Input:** Problem statement, timeline, industry, product type, known competitors
- **References:** `.agents/product-context.md` (if available)
- **Expected output:** 6-factor assessment (competitor, market/seasonal, platform/algorithm, regulatory, technology, macro-economic), each with WebSearch evidence

### Layer 1 Merge

After both agents return:
1. If external-check-agent found **Confirmed or Possible** external factors, add an "External Factors" branch to the tree
2. If all external factors were **Ruled Out**, note this in the analysis and proceed with the internal tree as-is
3. Pass the merged tree + external factor assessment to hypothesis-agent

---

## Layer 2 — Sequential: Hypothesis → Data Map → Verdict → Critic

### Step 1: hypothesis-agent
- **Input:** Merged L1 output (tree + external factors)
- **References:** `references/hypothesis-guide.md`, `references/logic-tree-examples.md`
- **Expected output:** If/Then/Because hypotheses for every leaf, ranked by testability (speed x impact)

### Step 2: data-mapper-agent
- **Input:** Ranked hypotheses from hypothesis-agent
- **References:** `references/logic-tree-examples.md`
- **Expected output:** Data requirement table — deciding data point, confirming evidence, rejecting evidence, source (tool → report → metric), owner, availability

### Step 3: Data Gathering Pause

**This is an interactive checkpoint. Do NOT skip it.**

Present the data requirements to the user:

> **"Share what you found for each hypothesis — data, screenshots, reports, CSVs, or describe what you saw."**

If user provides data files, read and analyze them directly — do not ask the user to summarize data you can read yourself.

If user hasn't gathered data yet:
- Use WebSearch for publicly available evidence: `"[competitor] launch [date range]"`, `"[industry] [metric] trend [year]"`, `"[tool name] outage [date]"`
- Point them to the specific sources listed in the data map
- Offer to search for any data that might be publicly available

**Do not proceed to verdict-agent without evidence.** Verdicts without data are speculation.

### Step 4: verdict-agent
- **Input:** Data map + gathered evidence from the user or WebSearch
- **Expected output:** Verdict per hypothesis (Confirmed/Rejected/Inconclusive), root cause statement with gap percentages, next step routing

### Step 5: critic-agent
- **Input:** Complete merged analysis (tree + external factors + hypotheses + data map + verdicts)
- **Expected output:** PASS or FAIL against 10-point quality gate

---

## Critic Gate

**Maximum 2 rewrite cycles.** If the critic returns FAIL:

1. Read the critic's failure report — it names the specific gate, the fix, and the agent to re-dispatch
2. Re-dispatch ONLY the named agent(s) with the critic's feedback
3. Re-merge and send back to critic-agent
4. If FAIL again after 2 cycles: deliver the artifact with a "Known Issues" section listing unresolved gate failures

---

## Inconclusive Handling

After the verdict-agent runs, check for Inconclusive verdicts:

| Potential Gap Explained | Action |
|------------------------|--------|
| **>50%** (high-impact) | **Must resolve** before moving to solution-design. Specify: data needed, source, access barrier, timeline, owner. |
| **10-50%** (medium-impact) | **Should resolve** if data is available within 1 week. Otherwise, note as risk and proceed. |
| **<10%** (low-impact) | **Skip** — proceed to solution-design. Note as unexplained variance. |

Designing solutions around an incomplete diagnosis is expensive. A high-impact Inconclusive hypothesis that explains 50%+ of the gap means your root cause statement is missing the biggest driver — solutions will target the wrong thing.

# Problem Analysis

## Phase 1: Problem Definition

### Problem Statement

[Metric] is [current] instead of [target], a gap of [X%/X units].
Started: [when]. Inflection point: [if known].

### Logic Tree

[Tree type: Math / Issue / Yes-No]

​```
[Problem statement]
├── [Branch 1]
│   ├── [Leaf 1a]
│   ├── [Leaf 1b]
│   └── [Leaf 1c]
├── [Branch 2]
│   ├── [Leaf 2a]
│   └── [Leaf 2b]
└── [Branch 3]
    ├── [Leaf 3a]
    └── [Leaf 3b]
​```

### MECE Check

- Mutually Exclusive: [confirm no overlaps]
- Collectively Exhaustive: [confirm no gaps]

### External Factor Scan

| Factor | Finding | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Competitor launch | [result] | Confirmed / Ruled Out / Possible |
| Market/seasonal shift | [result] | [status] |
| Platform/algorithm change | [result] | [status] |
| Regulatory/policy change | [result] | [status] |
| Technology change | [result] | [status] |
| Macro-economic conditions | [result] | [status] |

## Phase 2: Hypotheses (Ranked by Testability)

### 1. [Short name] — Priority: HIGH
**If** [cause], **then** [observable evidence], **because** [mechanism].
- **Deciding data:** [specific data point]
- **Source:** [Tool → Report → Metric]
- **Owner:** [person/team]
- **Confirming:** [what you'd see if true]
- **Rejecting:** [what you'd see if false]
- **Potential gap explained:** ~X%

### 2. [Short name] — Priority: HIGH
[Same format]

### 3. [Short name] — Priority: MEDIUM
[Same format]

## Phase 3: Root Cause Verdict

### Verdict Table

| # | Hypothesis | Verdict | Evidence | Gap |
|---|-----------|---------|----------|-----|
| 1 | [Short name] | Confirmed / Rejected / Inconclusive | [Specific data cited] | ~X% |
| 2 | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Root Cause Statement

**Root Cause 1 (~X% of gap):** [Cause], evidenced by [data].
[One sentence explaining the mechanism.]

**Root Cause 2 (~Y% of gap):** [Cause], evidenced by [data].
[One sentence explaining the mechanism.]

**Unexplained (~Z%):** [Description]. Next data needed: [what], from [where].

## Next Step

Run `solution-design` targeting:
1. [Root cause 1 — specific aspect to solve]
2. [Root cause 2 — specific aspect to solve]
```

## Worked Example

**User:** "Our signups are declining."

### Pre-Dispatch Interview
- "What's the current signup rate?" → "About 200/week, down from 350/week"
- "When did it start?" → "About 8 weeks ago"
- "Any changes around that time?" → "We launched a new homepage and changed our ad targeting"

**Problem statement:** Weekly signups are 200 instead of 350, a gap of 43%.

### Layer 1 — Parallel Dispatch

**tree-builder-agent output:**
```
Math Tree

Weekly signups declining (200 → 350 target)
├── Traffic volume declining (fewer people arriving)
│   ├── Paid traffic: ad targeting change reduced volume/quality
│   ├── Organic traffic: SEO impact from homepage redesign
│   └── Referral/direct: brand or word-of-mouth decline
├── Conversion rate declining (same traffic, fewer signups)
│   ├── Homepage redesign reduced clarity/trust
│   ├── Signup flow friction increased
│   └── Value proposition no longer resonates
└── Measurement change (signups happening but not counted)
    ├── Tracking code broken on new homepage
    └── Attribution model changed

MECE Check:
- Mutually Exclusive: Traffic volume vs. conversion rate vs. measurement are independent
- Collectively Exhaustive: All signup decline must come from fewer visitors, lower conversion, or miscounting
```

**external-check-agent output:**
```
| Factor | Finding | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Competitor launch | Searched "[competitor] launch 2026 Q1" — no launches found | Ruled Out |
| Market/seasonal shift | Searched "SaaS signup trends Q1 2026" — no industry-wide decline reported | Ruled Out |
| Platform/algorithm change | Searched "Google algorithm update Feb 2026" — no major update in period | Ruled Out |
| Regulatory/policy change | No relevant changes found | Ruled Out |
| Technology change | No relevant changes found | Ruled Out |
| Macro-economic conditions | Searched "SaaS spending Q1 2026" — stable | Ruled Out |

No external factors confirmed — proceed with internal analysis.
```

**Merge:** Tree used as-is (no external branches needed).

### Layer 2 — Sequential

**hypothesis-agent output (3 hypotheses, ranked):**
1. **Tracking broken** — Priority: HIGH. If the homepage redesign broke tracking, then GA4 shows a drop while DB signups remain stable, because the new template may not include the tracking script. ~100% if true. Test time: 1 hour.
2. **Ad targeting reduced quality** — Priority: HIGH. If the targeting change brought low-intent visitors, then paid conversion dropped while organic held steady, because broader targeting reaches people outside the ICP. ~50%. Test time: 2 hours.
3. **Homepage reduced conversion** — Priority: MEDIUM. If the new homepage is less clear, then all-source conversion dropped equally, because the design lacks social proof. ~40%. Test time: 1 day.

**data-mapper-agent output:**

| # | Hypothesis | Deciding Data | Source | Owner |
|---|-----------|---------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Tracking broken | GA4 signups vs. DB signups, 8-week comparison | GA4 Events + Production DB | Engineering |
| 2 | Ad targeting | Paid vs. organic conversion rate, before/after | GA4 → Acquisition → Traffic source → Conversion | Marketing (paid) |
| 3 | Homepage conversion | Bounce rate by source, before/after | GA4 → Pages → Homepage → Bounce rate | Product/Design |

### Data Gathering Pause

**Orchestrator presents data requirements to user.**

**User returns with data:**
- "Checked DB vs GA4 — both show the same drop. Tracking is fine."
- "Paid traffic conversion dropped from 3.5% to 1.2%. Organic is still at 4.1%."
- "Homepage bounce rate increased from 35% to 52% for all traffic."

### verdict-agent output:

| # | Hypothesis | Verdict | Evidence | Gap |
|---|-----------|---------|----------|-----|
| 1 | Tracking broken | **Rejected** | GA4 and DB both show 200/week. Tracking is correct. | 0% |
| 2 | Ad targeting reduced quality | **Confirmed** | Paid conversion dropped 66% (3.5% → 1.2%). Organic stable at 4.1%. | ~55% |
| 3 | Homepage reduced conversion | **Confirmed** | Bounce rate up 17pts across ALL sources. | ~35% |

**Root Cause Statement:**

**Root Cause 1 (~55% of gap):** Ad targeting change brought low-intent visitors, evidenced by paid conversion dropping 66% while organic held steady. The broader targeting reaches people outside the ICP.

**Root Cause 2 (~35% of gap):** Homepage redesign reduced trust/clarity, evidenced by bounce rate rising 17 points across all traffic sources. The new page likely lacks the social proof or clear value prop of the old design.

**Unexplained (~10%):** Minor variance, possibly seasonal. No action needed.

### critic-agent output: PASS (all 10 gates satisfied)

**Next step:** Run `solution-design` targeting:
1. Paid targeting — restore or improve audience quality
2. Homepage — restore trust signals and clarify value proposition

## Anti-Patterns

**Too-shallow tree** — Stopping at one level produces branches that are categories, not testable causes. INSTEAD: Always decompose to at least 2 levels; the leaf should be something you can look up in a specific data source.

**Overlapping branches** — If fixing Branch A would automatically fix Branch B, the tree is not mutually exclusive. INSTEAD: Restructure until each branch is independently testable. Use the "if I fix A, does B still exist?" check.

**Restatements as causes** — "Conversion is low because conversion dropped" restates the problem. INSTEAD: Every leaf must name a mechanism — what specifically changed and why.

**Missing measurement branch** — Most trees cover demand-side and supply-side but forget instrumentation errors. INSTEAD: Always include a "measurement/tracking" branch — it's the fastest to test and explains 100% of the gap when true.

**Single tree type for everything** — Math trees work for decomposable metrics; issue trees work for multi-factor problems. INSTEAD: Match tree type to problem shape. If the metric has a formula, use a math tree. If not, use an issue tree.

**Unfalsifiable hypotheses** — "If onboarding is bad, then users churn" cannot be tested because "bad" has no measurable threshold. INSTEAD: Every "then" clause must name a specific metric and direction. Every hypothesis must define what rejection looks like.

**Testing everything at once** — Running 5 tests simultaneously makes it impossible to attribute results. INSTEAD: Rank by testability and test sequentially — fast eliminations narrow the field.

**Confirmation bias in evidence selection** — Choosing only data sources likely to confirm the hypothesis. INSTEAD: Every hypothesis must define both confirming AND rejecting evidence before gathering data.

**Premature verdicts** — Declaring "Confirmed" after seeing one data point that loosely supports the hypothesis. INSTEAD: Every verdict requires evidence that specifically matches or contradicts the "then" clause. "Seems likely" is not Confirmed.

**Confusing correlation with causation** — "Signups dropped when we changed the homepage, so the homepage caused it." INSTEAD: Correlation identifies candidates; causation requires the mechanism ("because" clause) to hold. Check: does the because explain the data?

**Skipping the "because" clause** — Omitting the mechanism makes hypotheses unfalsifiable. INSTEAD: The "because" explains why the cause produces the effect — it's what you learn from when the hypothesis is wrong.

**Ignoring inconclusive results** — Marking ambiguous evidence as "Rejected" to simplify the analysis. INSTEAD: Inconclusive is valid. It means more data is needed. Specify what data, from where, owned by whom.

**Gap percentages that don't add up** — If root causes explain 140% of the gap (or only 30%), the analysis has double-counting or missing causes. INSTEAD: Percentages should roughly sum to 100%. Re-check for overlapping branches or missed causes.
